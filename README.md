# Bitgram

Welcome to Bitgram, the official decentralized Instagram built and powered by the [BitClout blockchain](https://fixme).

# Installation
## Requirements
Make sure you have the following already installed:
* Node v15.4.0
* NPM v7.7.6
* Expo 4.5.0
* macOS version 11
* XCode

## Local Development

Bitgram is developed using Expo, a framework to build applications using React on mobile and web platforms using one codebase. To run and develop against the codebase, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will run the Expo server, which watches for file changes and updates to your code to re-build the frontend assets as you develop. In the Expo UI, you can open Bitgram in an iOS Simulator, Android Simulator or a browser.

## Building for Production
